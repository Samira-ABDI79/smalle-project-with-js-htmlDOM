<h1 style="text-align:center;">&#10024;JavaScript Projects You Can Build to Perfect Your Coding Skills&#10024;</h1>
<p>I know it’s sometimes difficult to find JavaScript project ideas that match your skill level and are fun to build.</p>
<h2>How to choose the right JavaScript project to learn faster
</h2>
<p>Now, the best way to learn JavaScript – or any other programming language – is to put in the time and effort to build tons of projects.
Your time is limited, so you want to build JavaScript practice projects that are not too easy.
After all, if you keep repeating things you already know, you are not making any progress towards your long-term coding goals.
At the same time,&#127773; you want to choose projects that are not too difficult, either.&#127771; The trick is to find a project idea that is just a tad above your current skill level.
Hence, the key is to start small and set realistic expectations for your learning path. The last thing you want is to start with an ambitious project and end up feeling frustrated when you get stuck.

<p>Coding a JavaScript stopwatch is an easy little project you can build in one day even as a beginner. &#127809;Your stopwatch needs three buttons for user interaction:</p>
<pre>
1:Start
2:Stop
3:Reset

<p>Building your own digital clock with JavaScript is a relatively easy small project to practice variables and simple if loops.
<li>JavaScript calculator</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="https://github.com/Samira-ABDI79/smalle-project-with-js-htmlDOM/blob/developer/image/JavaScript-calculator-project-for-beginners.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-calculator-project-for-beginners" />
<p>Coding a good old calculator is excellent practice for your JavaScript skills. Create a clean interface with HTML and CSS and then add different features with JavaScript.
<br />
Start with just a few basic operators and buttons for:
<ul>
<li>Additions</li>
<li>Subtractions</li>
<li>Multiplications</li>
<li>Divisions</li>
</ul>
<li>JavaScript drum kit</li><br />
<img src="JavaScript-drum-kit-project.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-drum-kit-project" />
<p>If you want to build a JavaScript project that is tons of fun but still allows you to learn quite a bit, you’re going to love this example.
<br />
I discovered this JavaScript drum kit a while back, and I fell in love with it instantly. Seriously, it’s such an entertaining and fun project to build, trust me!</p>
<li>Guess the Color game</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-RGB-color-guessing-game.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-RGB-color-guessing-game" />
<p>Coding a color guessing game with JavaScript is quite straightforward:</p><br />
<p>
<br />
1:You build a game where the player will see a single RGB value for a color.
<br />
2:The player has to click on a color they think matches the RGB value displayed.
You can easily add more features to the game to make it more difficult&#127822;
<br />
For example, you could limit the number of guesses or give the player three “lives”. With every wrong guess, they would lose one, and the game would be over when they run out of lives.
</p>
<li>Hangman game</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-hangman-game.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-hangman-game" />
<p>
Building a Hangman game is one of the best JavaScript project ideas for beginners who want a bit of a challenge.
<br />&#127823;
If you’re not familiar, the hangman game is about guessing a random word by guessing letters one by one. If the player runs out of guesses, the game is over.
<br />
Although the gameplay may sound simple, you need to consider a few critical elements in your JavaScript code:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Set a maximum limit for guesses.</li>
<li>Display the remaining number of guesses to the player.</li>
<li>Provide the player with an interface to input their guesses.</li></ul>
This beginner JavaScript project will probably take you a bit longer, but it’s great practice.<br /> You will need to think about random choice, variables, boolean values, inputs and outputs, strings, lengths, and more.
</p>
<li>Tic Tac Toe</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="Build-your-own-JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe-game.png" alt="Build-your-own-JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe-game" width="400px" height="200px" />
<p>
Building a simple Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript is another excellent project idea you can finish in a single day.
<br />
You will create a 3×3 grid where two players will take turns marking the grid with cross and circle symbols. The first player to get three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
<br />
Although the game seems simple, you need to figure out how to create the logic that follows the game rules in JavaScript.
<br />
Hence, before you start writing any code, break down the flow of the game into logical steps first.
<br />
For a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, I find it helpful to draw a small flow chart to visualize the different outcomes of the game. When I can see the flow on paper, it’s easier to start writing actual code.</p>
<li>Pong game</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-pong-game.png" alt="JavaScript-pong-game" width="400px" height="200px" />
<br /><br />
Pong was one of my favorite video games back in the day!
<br />
Did you know that it was the very first commercially successful video game ever?
<br />
Building the game in JavaScript takes some work, but the end results can is tons of fun to play.
<br />
Again, start by thinking about the rules of the game and map out the different events your code needs to cover.
<br />
As you build the game, you will probably come up with a few ideas on how to make it more fun.
<br />
Also, you may want to create different difficulty levels for your game. For example:
<ul>
<li>The ball could move faster after a given number of rounds</li>
<li>To make things trickier for the player, allow for the computer to move the paddle more quickly</li></ul>
Pong is a rather complex project if you are entirely new to JavaScript. I think the most difficult part of this project idea is to make sure the computer doesn’t always win.
<li>Pairs game</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-pairs-game.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-pairs-game" />
<br /><br />
<p>Coding a JavaScript memory matching game or pairs game is another fun project you can build for fun (and for your portfolio!).
<br />
    The logic of the game is simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>There are a given number of cards on the table facing down.</li>
        <li>The player needs to find all the pairs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, you may want to add more difficulty by limiting the number of guesses or by setting a time limit for the game to be finished.
<br />
        This is another great project for practicing not just your JavaScript skills but your HTML and CSS, too.
        <br />
        The easiest way to create the matching cards is to put different colors on them that the player needs to match. But you can also use images, icons, or numbers, for example.</p>
<br />
<li>Maze game</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-maze-game-project-idea.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-maze-game-project-idea" />
<br /><br />
<p>I was a huge fan of drawing my own maze games when I was a kid in the early ’90s. Therefore, learning how to code my own maze with JavaScript was so much fun.
<br />
    As for the difficulty of this JavaScript project, it is somewhat more demanding.
    <br />
    Thus, if you are just getting started, make sure you feel comfortable enough with the language before you start building this game.</p>
<br />
<li>Simon game</li>
<br />
<li>Platformer game</li><br />
<p>This JavaScript project is great for intermediate students who want to practice their model-view-controller skills. Thus, you will learn how to organize your code to build a strong foundation for the project. This is something you definitely want to learn for the future.</p>
<li>Tip calculator</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-tip-calculator.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-tip-calculator" />
<br /><br />
<p>Calculating tips can be tricky sometimes – especially after a long day of coding.
    <br />
    If you want to save the trouble of calculating your tips manually, just build your own tip calculator you can use whenever, wherever. Plus, this tool never makes mistakes or errors in calculations.
    <br />
    When you’ve built a simple tip calculator, you can always add more features to make it more user-friendly.
    <br />
    For instance, let’s say you want to travel abroad soon. Find out what’s an appropriate tip level there and add a country selection option to your calculator.</p>
<li>Palindrome checker</li>
<br /><br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-palindrome-checker.png" width="400" height="200" alt="JavaScript-palindrome-checker" />
<br />
<p>A palindrome is a phrase or a word that reads the same backwards and forwards.&#10083;
<br />
    Building a simple palindrome checker is great practice for working with strings and manipulating them with JavaScript. Plus, checking for palindromes can be a lot of fun!</p>
<li>To-do list</li>
<p>JavaScript is a wonderful tool for coding dynamic, interactive lists where users can add, edit, delete, and move items. It’s something you can’t achieve with just HTML and CSS.
<br />
    If you are anything like me, you have a running list of seemingly never-ending to-dos:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dealing with e-mails</li>
        <li>Managing projects</li>
        <li>Learning new things</li>
        <li>Maintaining your portfolio</li>
        <li>Knowing what groceries to buy</li>
        <li>Places to visit on your next holiday</li>
        <li>Movies to watch on Netflix</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make your life easier, you can build your own custom-coded to-do list as a JavaScript project right away. Start small and create a single list where you can simply add and delete items.
<br />&#11088;
        As your skills improve, you can add new features to help you manage your to-dos more efficiently.
        <br />
        For instance, you could use multiple lists next to each other to categorize your to-dos.&#127804;
        <br />
        A particularly handy feature would be to enable a drag-and-drop feature for moving to-dos between the different lists and columns.</p>
<li>JavaScript timeline</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-vertical-timeline-project.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-vertical-timeline-project" />
<br /><br />
<p>If you want to become a front-end web developer, a custom-made JavaScript timeline can be a great feature for building websites for freelance clients, for instance.
<br />
    Businesses and start-ups often want to display their most significant milestones on their website.
    <br />
    Also, you can use the code from your JS timeline for other similar applications.
    <br />
    For example, let’s say you want to break down important steps into bite-sized portions for your website visitors.
    <br />
    With a JavaScript timeline, you can display small bits of a specific story or piece of content to your readers without overwhelming them with too much information at once.</p>
<li>JavaScript animated nav toggle</li>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful tool for creating interactive navigation toggles such as this one. It’s simple and easy to code, but it can make your website more interesting and engaging.
<br />
    If you want to pursue front-end web development, this is a must-have skill to add under your belt!</p>
<li>JavaScript quiz</li>
<br /><br />
<img src="JavaScript-quiz.png" width="500px" height="250px" alt="JavaScript-quiz.png" />
<br /><br />
<p>Everybody loves a good quiz! Luckily, building a small quiz with JavaScript is quite easy – and they can be super helpful.
<br />
    If you want to make money freelancing, you can build a portfolio website to showcase your projects. Use a quiz on the site to help potential clients find the right services for their problems, for example.
    <br />
    Or, if you blog about coding (go you!), you can help your readers find the right resources and articles based on what they want to learn.
    <br />&#127754;
    Simply create a small quiz to determine what their goals are and direct them to tutorials and blog posts to help them get started.</p>
<li>JavaScript mouseover effect</li>
<p>Mouseover effects are a routine part of web development with JavaScript – and they are a lot of fun!
<br />
    A mouseover effect simply means adding interactivity to certain elements and sections of your web page. For instance, in this project you will create an area of happy bouncing balls that expand when you hover your mouse over them.
    <br />
    This is a JavaScript project you can build over an afternoon or during a weekend of JavaScript coding. And once you are done, I bet you have a few further ideas for building more mouseover effects with JS!</p>
<li>JavaScript weather app</li>
<p>Building a weather app is a great project idea if you are new to JavaScript and you don’t have too many projects in your portfolio just yet.
<br />
    This project will teach you how to pull data from an API and display it dynamically on your web page.</p>
<li>JavaScript browser code editor</li>
<br />
<img src="JavaScript-micro-browser-code-editor-project.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-micro-browser-code-editor-project" />
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to code your own mini code editor in JavaScript? I think this is a cool project idea for beginners!
<br />
Here are a few ideas for additional features for your code editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use CSS for syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Allow the user to switch between languages</li>
<li>Add another screen next to your editor where the user can run the code</li>&#127756;
</ul>
</ol>
