# learn


to do App is a small project with html, CSS, javaScript languages. With this project you can get acquainted with the structure of these three languages and the bootstrap library

A to-do list app lets you write, organize, and reprioritize your tasks more efficiently. They also let you attach notes, links, and files to a task, and many let you see when someone else has completed a task. In many ways, a good to-do app is the ultimate productivity app










If you want to build a JavaScript project that is tons of fun but still allows you to learn quite a bit, you’re going to love this example.

I discovered this JavaScript drum kit a while back, and I fell in love with it instantly. Seriously, it’s such an entertaining and fun project to build, trust me!

JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe
Building a simple Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript is another excellent project idea you can finish in a single day.

You will create a 3×3 grid where two players will take turns marking the grid with cross and circle symbols. The first player to get three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Although the game seems simple, you need to figure out how to create the logic that follows the game rules in JavaScript.

Hence, before you start writing any code, break down the flow of the game into logical steps first.

For a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, I find it helpful to draw a small flow chart to visualize the different outcomes of the game. When I can see the flow on paper, it’s easier to start writing actual code.
