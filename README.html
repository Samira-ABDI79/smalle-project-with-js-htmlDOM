<h1 style="text-align:center;">&#10024;JavaScript Projects You Can Build to Perfect Your Coding Skills&#10024;</h1>
<p>I know it’s sometimes difficult to find JavaScript project ideas that match your skill level and are fun to build.</p>
<h2>How to choose the right JavaScript project to learn faster
</h2>
<p>Now, the best way to learn JavaScript – or any other programming language – is to put in the time and effort to build tons of projects.
Your time is limited, so you want to build JavaScript practice projects that are not too easy.
After all, if you keep repeating things you already know, you are not making any progress towards your long-term coding goals.
At the same time, you want to choose projects that are not too difficult, either. The trick is to find a project idea that is just a tad above your current skill level.
Hence, the key is to start small and set realistic expectations for your learning path. The last thing you want is to start with an ambitious project and end up feeling frustrated when you get stuck.

<p>Coding a JavaScript stopwatch is an easy little project you can build in one day even as a beginner. Your stopwatch needs three buttons for user interaction:</p>
<pre>
1:Start
2:Stop
3:Reset
</pre>
<li>JavaScript clock</li><br />
<img src="D:\smalle-project-with-js-htmlDOM\image\JavaScript-clock-project.png" width="200px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-clock-project" />
<p>Building your own digital clock with JavaScript is a relatively easy small project to practice variables and simple if loops.
<li>JavaScript calculator</li><br />
<img src="D:\smalle-project-with-js-htmlDOM\image\JavaScript-calculator-project-for-beginners.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-calculator-project-for-beginners" />
<p>Coding a good old calculator is excellent practice for your JavaScript skills. Create a clean interface with HTML and CSS and then add different features with JavaScript.
<br />
Start with just a few basic operators and buttons for:
<ul>
<li>Additions</li>
<li>Subtractions</li>
<li>Multiplications</li>
<li>Divisions</li>
</ul>
<li>JavaScript drum kit</li><br />
<img src="D:\smalle-project-with-js-htmlDOM\image\JavaScript-drum-kit-project.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-drum-kit-project" />
<p>If you want to build a JavaScript project that is tons of fun but still allows you to learn quite a bit, you’re going to love this example.
<br />
I discovered this JavaScript drum kit a while back, and I fell in love with it instantly. Seriously, it’s such an entertaining and fun project to build, trust me!</p>
<li>Guess the Color game</li><br />
<img src="D:\smalle-project-with-js-htmlDOM\image\JavaScript-RGB-color-guessing-game.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-RGB-color-guessing-game" />
<p>Coding a color guessing game with JavaScript is quite straightforward:</p><br />
<p>
<br />1:You build a game where the player will see a single RGB value for a color.
<br />2:The player has to click on a color they think matches the RGB value displayed.
You can easily add more features to the game to make it more difficult.
<br />
For example, you could limit the number of guesses or give the player three “lives”. With every wrong guess, they would lose one, and the game would be over when they run out of lives.
</p>
<li>Hangman game</li><br />
<img src="D:\smalle-project-with-js-htmlDOM\image\JavaScript-hangman-game.png" width="400px" height="200px" alt="JavaScript-hangman-game.png" />
<p>
Building a Hangman game is one of the best JavaScript project ideas for beginners who want a bit of a challenge.
<br />
If you’re not familiar, the hangman game is about guessing a random word by guessing letters one by one. If the player runs out of guesses, the game is over.
<br />
Although the gameplay may sound simple, you need to consider a few critical elements in your JavaScript code:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Set a maximum limit for guesses.</li>
<li>Display the remaining number of guesses to the player.</li>
<li>Provide the player with an interface to input their guesses.</li></ul>
This beginner JavaScript project will probably take you a bit longer, but it’s great practice.<br /> You will need to think about random choice, variables, boolean values, inputs and outputs, strings, lengths, and more.
</p>
<li>Tic Tac Toe</li><br />
<p>
Building a simple Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript is another excellent project idea you can finish in a single day.
<br />
You will create a 3×3 grid where two players will take turns marking the grid with cross and circle symbols. The first player to get three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
<br />
Although the game seems simple, you need to figure out how to create the logic that follows the game rules in JavaScript.
<br />
Hence, before you start writing any code, break down the flow of the game into logical steps first.
<br />
For a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, I find it helpful to draw a small flow chart to visualize the different outcomes of the game. When I can see the flow on paper, it’s easier to start writing actual code.
</p>
<li>Pong game</li><br />
Pong was one of my favorite video games back in the day!
<br />
Did you know that it was the very first commercially successful video game ever?
<br />
Building the game in JavaScript takes some work, but the end results can is tons of fun to play.
<br />
Again, start by thinking about the rules of the game and map out the different events your code needs to cover.
<br />
As you build the game, you will probably come up with a few ideas on how to make it more fun.
<br />
Also, you may want to create different difficulty levels for your game. For example:
<ul>
<li>The ball could move faster after a given number of rounds</li>
<li>To make things trickier for the player, allow for the computer to move the paddle more quickly</li></ul>
Pong is a rather complex project if you are entirely new to JavaScript. I think the most difficult part of this project idea is to make sure the computer doesn’t always win.
